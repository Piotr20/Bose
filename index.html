               <div class="philosophy_image"></div>
               <p>Since Bose Corporation was founded in 1964 by then Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor
                    Dr. Amar G. Bose, the original philosophies and founding principles have not changed.
                    <br><br>
                    Bose maintains an exceptionally strong commitment to research, for it is within the discipline of
                    research that yesterday’s fiction becomes tomorrow’s reality. We strive to identify things which,
                    when made better, improve people’s lives.
                    <br><br>
                    But it’s more than just research. We aim for excellence in everything we do. From the way we run our
                    business to our customer service. From the products to the owner’s manuals you’ll use to set them
                    up. In everything we do, we truly believe that “good enough” is merely a starting point.</p><a
