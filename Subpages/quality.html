          <h1>How to pick real quality product?</h1>

          <h3>Don’t confuse high quality with luxury</h3>
          <p>Don’t confuse high quality with luxury. High quality products aren’t just for snooty elitists who want to
               show off their bling.
               <br> <br>
               A Mercedes S500 may be a luxury sedan with aspects of quality, but it’s really just an endless money-pit
               with astronomical depreciation. A Toyota Avalon, on the other hand, is still surprisingly luxurious but
               will last waaay longer and hold its value. It’s essentially a Lexus with a Toyota badge.A savvy consumer
               knows the difference and chooses well-made products to streamline and stabilize their busy life.</p>
          <h3>Why not much cheap things?</h3>
          <p>Well, lets be honest every of us bought something cheap and then what happened? I guess in most cases after
               one or two weeks maybe months you get the point it was broken. When it comes to something that is not so
               much important I guess noone cares about it but what if you would buy something that is more important
               for example some important part of a car then guess what can happen.
               <br><br>
               But not overdo it of course it is fine to buy something cheap instead of expensive in some cases.
               For example when you don't have enough money for something higher quality and you really need it a good
               idea is too buy a cheaper replacemnt and well, later replace it with this high quality.
          </p>
          <h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>
          <p>Every year over 300 million pairs of sneakers are thrown out in America. Imagine if everyone decided to buy
               decent quality shoes that lasted 3 or more years?<br><br>

               The simple fact is that higher quality products typically last much longer which means that there is far
               less waste in our landfills.<br><br>

               High Quality products are far more likely to be serviceable too. That means they can be repaired multiple
               times instead of just getting thrown out.
          </p>
          <h3>What does quality gives you?</h3>
          <p>
               So, what you reciving for a higher price?<br>Well, higher quality products are made of better materials
               what makes them last longer so for example you would have bought cheaper thing twice and they can not
               last as much time as one higher quality product but you spent your mone twice. Isn't it tricky? I gueess
               it is. <br>
               The brands that sell high quality product mostly really care about their reputation what it means for
               you? <br>

               Well, things such as better custommer service, better guarantee process, feeling of luxurness etc.
               Also, what's mot so intuitive is that longer lasting things means less waste what means that enviroment
               will be thankful for this.
